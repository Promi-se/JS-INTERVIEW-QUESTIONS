            <h3>1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage by making it more lively and interactive. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.</p><hr>

            <h3>2. Who developed JavaScript, and what was the first name of JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, who was a Netscape programmer. Brendan Eich developed this new scripting language in just ten days in the year September 1995. At the time of its launch, JavaScript was initially called Mocha. After that, it was called Live Script and later known as JavaScript.</p><hr>

            <h3>3. What are the features of JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>Following are the features of JavaScript: <br>

                1. It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. <br>
                2. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. <br>
                3. It is complementary to and integrated with Java. <br>
                4. It is an open and cross-platform scripting language. <br>
                5. It is Complementary to HTML</p><hr>

            <h3>4. List some of the advantages of JavaScript.</h3>
            <p>Some of the advantages of JavaScript <br>

                1. Server interaction is less <br>
                2. Feedback to the visitors is immediate <br>
                3. Interactivity is high <br>
                4.Interfaces are richer <br>
            
                <br> or- <br>

            Following are the advantages of using JavaScript − <br>

                1. Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server. <br>
                2. Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don’t have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something. <br>
                3. Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard. <br>
                4. Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

            <h3>5. List some of the disadvantages of JavaScript.</h3>
            <p>Some of the disadvantages of JavaScript are: <br>

                1. No support for multithreading <br>
                2. No support for multiprocessing <br>
                3. Reading and writing of files is not  allowed <br>

            <h3>6. Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language?</h3>
            <p>Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language.  The language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.</p><hr>

                7. Object</p> <hr>

            <h3>8. What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
            <p>isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number; otherwise, it is false.</p> <br>

            <h3>9. What is negative Infinity?</h3>
            <p> Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing negative number by zero.</p> <hr>

            <h3>10. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
            <p>Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered. <br>
            Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.</p><hr>

            <h3>11. What is a prompt box?</h3>
            <p>A prompt box is a box that allows the user to enter input by providing a text box. A label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.</p> <hr>

            <h3>What is ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>This’ keyword refers to the object from where it was called. This has different values depending on where it is used. In a method, this refers to the owner object and in a function, this refers to the global object.</p> <hr>

            <h3>12. What is the working of timers in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or repeat the code in a given interval. This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval, and clearInterval. <br>
            The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The setInterval(function, delay) function repeatedly executes the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when canceled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.
            <br>
            Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.</p> <hr>

            <h3>13. Which symbol is used for comments in Javascript?</h3>
            <p>// for Single line comments and

                Comment
                
                */</p> <hr>

            <h3>14. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variable will have only two scopes. <br>
                • Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it is visible everywhere in your JavaScript code. <br>
                • Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.</p> <hr>
            
            <h3>15. What is Callback?</h3>
            <p>A callback is a plain JavaScript function passed to some method as an argument or option. It is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing, hence the name ‘call back‘. In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions.</p> <hr>

            <h3>16. What is DOM? What is the use of document object?</h3>
            <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. A document object represents the HTML document. It can be used to access and change the content of HTML.</p> <hr>
